> **IMPORTANT:** This project is work in progress. It's still in very early
> stages of development and isn't ready for use.

Created with privacy in mind, Replay is a new way to browse and watch your
YouTube videos on laptops and phones. Check out the latest trends or quickly
find that video of kittens that you love so much without having to open slow
browsers that only know how to consume all the precious resources of your PC.

## Install

### Stable

Since this project is still under active development, there's no current stable
build. You'll see a Flathub badge here when there's one.

### Development

Development builds are automatically generated every time a new change lands on
the `main` branch, and are marked with a custom icon and style. You can install
a development build simply by going to the
[actions](https://github.com/nahuelwexd/Replay/actions) tab of this repository,
and downloading one of those that have been successfully generated.

> **NOTE:** You must download the artifact called "Flatpak Bundles", which
> contains 2 flatpak files ready to install: the application and the locales.
